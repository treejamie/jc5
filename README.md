Personal "biosite".

It isn't version five, as I have had many since I started doing a personal website back in the early 2000's.

At some point in 2022 I grew tired of maintaining a database driven personal website and I switched to a static site generator - hugo.

There's a branch of this code that is using [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and it will probably make it into production.
