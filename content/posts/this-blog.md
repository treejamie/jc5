###  Deletion

In 2018 by accident, when attempting to cleanup and backup my AWS account, I  deleted all of the assets from my decade-ish of blog posts. It made sense, rather than to cry over spilt milk, to then delete the blog posts as well. At least that made sense to me.  Some (*sensible I suppose*) people may have instead attempted to recover the files, and solve the problem. An event had unfolded before me, but I didn't see it as a problem, I saw it as an opportunity. It was an opportunity to open up some mental space. A opportunity to lesson my non-professional technical surface but most important an opportunity to let something go that had been a part of me for nine years. This blog will explore what happened in that mental space at length, as events unfold.


###  Social

More recently I annihilated all of my social accounts - Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn etc etc. I (*me, not you*) found no use or practical application for them in my life.  My experience of these platforms and their impact on my attention was not positive. This blog will explore attention in some depth and hopefully in a higher quality than "man writes uninformed opinion based blog posts". This kind of writing takes time, and so events must unfold first.

###  Privacy

Finally, privacy became a concern for me. Professionally, a great deal of my work since 2016 has been based on international privacy legislation and regulations. I could not be in that world and fail to apply the principals personally. Hence, where I freely gave my full name to have the "I was here first" on web services, I have been on a mission to remove such things. The goal was, and is, to remove myself from all text based and image based search results. I started in 2020, and I expect this work to continue. Privacy is important to me as I no longer consider the web a neutral space. It has become hostile as default. I will explore this idea on this blog.


###  Where have I been since 2018?

So where have I been? I've been at work. I've been meditating. I've been in the workshop. I've been running and moving heavy things. I've been at home. I've been with my family.  But most of all, I've been deep in contemplation. In a general sense it is this contemplation that this blog will explore â€“ as events unfold.
